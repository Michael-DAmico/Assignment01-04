Project Summary: Flight Data Analysis

This project is a flight data analysis tool developed in Java to process and analyze historical flight records for domestic flights in the U.S. between 1995 and 2009. The program reads flight data from a CSV file and provides various methods to extract insights and perform specific analyses.

The project consists of several key components:

Airport Class: This class represents an airport's details, including the airport's name, city, and state. It is used to store origin and destination airport data for each flight.

Flight Class: The Flight class holds details about individual flights, such as origin and destination airports, flight date, number of passengers, available seats, and flight distance.

MyAnalyzer Class: This class contains methods to perform specific analyses on the flight data:

Identify all unique airports in the state of Maine.
Determine the maximum number of passengers on a single flight arriving at Portland (PWM), Maine.
Calculate the percentage of flights that were fully booked.
Compute the average number of passengers on flights from Portland, Maine (PWM) to Florida in the year 2009.
MyDataReader Class: This class reads flight data from a CSV file and converts it into an array of Flight objects. It processes each line of the file and maps the data fields into corresponding Flight and Airport instances.

program1 Class: This class contains the main method that serves as the entry point for running the program. It reads the flight data file, runs the analysis methods from the MyAnalyzer class, and prints the results along with the time taken to perform each task.

Key Features:
File Reading: The project processes a large dataset (up to 3 million flight records) from a CSV file.
Efficient Analysis: The program performs various flight data analysis tasks, such as calculating maximum passengers, finding unique airports in a state, and more.
Performance Measurement: Each analysis taskâ€™s execution time is measured and displayed to ensure efficient processing of the dataset.
Use Case:
The project is useful for analyzing historical trends in domestic U.S. air travel, particularly focusing on airports in Maine and flights to and from Portland, Maine (PWM). It provides insights into flight capacity, passenger traffic, and the distribution of airports across different states.
